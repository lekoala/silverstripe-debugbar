# System logs and messages

The "Messages" tab will show you a list of anything that has been processed by [a SilverStripe logger](https://docs.silverstripe.org/en/4/developer_guides/debugging/error_handling/) during a page execution:

You can filter the list by type by clicking on one of the log level buttons in the bottom right corner.

**Note:** At times, other DebugBar components may also send messages to this tab.
